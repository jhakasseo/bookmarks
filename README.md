## Communication
* [Bohm Dialogue](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohm_Dialogue) - (also known as Bohmian Dialogue or "Dialogue in the Spirit of David Bohm") is a freely flowing group conversation in which participants attempt to reach a common understanding, experiencing everyone's point of view fully, equally and nonjudgementally.[1] This can lead to new and deeper understanding. The purpose is to solve the communication crises that face society,[2] and indeed the whole of human nature and consciousness.

> - Get of all large meetings, unless you’re certain they are providing value to the whole audience, in which case keep them very short.
> - Also get rid of frequent meetings
> - Walk out of a meeting or drop off a call as soon as it is obvious you aren’t adding value.
> - Don’t use acronyms or nonsense words for objects
> - Communication should travel via the shortest path necessary to get the job done
> - A major source of issues is poor communication between depts. The way to solve this is allow free flow of information between all levels
> - If following a “company rule” is obviously ridiculous in a particular situation, such that it would make for a great Dilbert cartoon, then the rule should change.

No, instead, it talks about cooperation.
